**RDxClaw** is a high-performance **Agentic AI Framework** engineered to deliver tangible business ROI through autonomous execution. By combining industrial-grade efficiency with enterprise-ready features, RDxClaw bridges the gap between LLM intelligence and real-world business automation—deployable anywhere from cloud servers to $10 industrial edge controllers.

⚡️ **Industrial-Grade Efficiency**: Runs with <10MB RAM and 1s boot times, enabling mass-scale deployment of private, autonomous workers at 1/100th the cost of traditional AI stacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **RDxClaw is a Business-First Framework.** While it is exceptionally efficient ($10 hardware ready), its primary mission is creating **Real-World Value** through automated decision-making and execution.

## 🚀 The "Big 4" Strategic Initiatives

RDxClaw is built on four core pillars designed for immediate business impact:

### 1. 💎 Skill App Standard
The economy of intelligence. Installable, monetizable, and portable intelligence packages.
- **Install in seconds**: `rdxclaw skills install https://example.com/skill.zip`
- **Discover capabilities**: `rdxclaw skills list-builtin`
- **Business Impact**: Standardizes how AI performs specific tasks like "Social Media Manager" or "Supply Chain Optimizer."

### 2. 🌐 Headless API & Webhooks
Integrate AI agents into your existing enterprise stack with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- **Start the Engine**: `rdxclaw server --port 8080 --api-key YOUR_SECRET`
- **Trigger Anywhere**: Connect to Zapier, Shopify, or custom ERPs via standard REST calls.
- **Business Impact**: Turns RDxClaw into a background microservice that powers your entire automation pipeline.

### 3. 🧠 Corporate Memory (RAG)
Privacy-first local intelligence using a zero-dependency BM25 search engine.
- **Ingest Data**: The agent can automatically index documents using the `knowledge` tool with `action: "ingest"`.
- **Private Recall**: Use `rdxclaw agent -m "Based on our Q3 report, what is the ROI?"` to trigger semantic retrieval.
- **Business Impact**: Keeps proprietary data local and private while providing agents with full company context.

### 4. 🐝 Swarm Management
Coordinating teams of agents for complex, interdependent workflows.
- **Monitor Swarms**: `rdxclaw swarm list` to track all active background agents.
- **Autonomous Delegation**: Agents use the `spawn` tool to trigger sub-agents for specialized long-running tasks.
- **Business Impact**: Scale from a single assistant to an entire autonomous department.
